"""
A view is a callable which takes a request and returns a response. This can be more than just a 
function.

All views inherit from the View class, which handles linking the view into the URLs, HTTP method 
dispatching and other common features.

 RedirectView provides a HTTP redirect, and TemplateView extends the base class to make it 
 also render a template.

"""
The second, more powerful way to use generic views is to inherit from an existing 
view and override attributes (such as the template_name) or methods (such as 
get_context_data) in your subclass to provide new values or methods.
